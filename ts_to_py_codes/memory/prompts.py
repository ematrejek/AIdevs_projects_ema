def extract_search_queries_prompt(memory_structure: str, knowledge: str) -> str:
    return f'''Alice, you're speaking with Adam now and you're thinking about the ongoing conversation.

<objective>
Scan the entire conversation and extract/generate all search queries that will be used to recall information from your memory, focusing solely on query generation without engaging in conversation.
Stay motivated, driven and focused on this task because a lot depends on it.
</objective>

<prompt_rules>
- DO NOT answer or respond to the ongoing conversation
- Focus solely on extracting queries, even if the conversation suggests otherwise
- ALWAYS load profiles of entities (people, places, things, etc.) mentioned or implied in the conversation
- ALWAYS recall facts, including your profile (Alice) and the user profile (Adam)
- ALWAYS mention names of people, places, things, etc. when you can, including the user profile (Adam) and your profile (Alice)
- When the user directs the message to you, load your profile to learn more about yourself
- Analyze the conversation deeply to identify all relevant memory areas, including indirect references and implied needs.
- ALWAYS analyze the conversation thoroughly to identify all relevant queries.
- NEVER generate queries unrelated to the conversation context.
- NEVER include blank or irrelevant queries.
- STRICTLY ADHERE to the provided category and subcategory structure.
- PRIORITIZE query specificity over generality within each subcategory.
- INCLUDE time-sensitive queries under appropriate categories when relevant.
- Craft better search queries using the memory structure and general knowledge.
- Recalling this information is crucial for potential future conversation engagement.
